# Timesheet Reminder Power Automate Flow

## Overview
This Power Automate flow is designed to send weekly reminders for timesheet submission to employees. The flow triggers every Monday at 4 PM, sending an adaptive card to each employee listed in an Excel sheet. The card contains a reminder message and an acknowledgment button. Based on user responses, the flow updates the status in the Excel sheet, sends a success or pending email, and filters out those who have not responded.

## Flow Description

### Trigger:
- **Recurrence**: The flow triggers every Monday at 4:00 PM.

### Actions:
1. **Post Adaptive Card**:
   - An adaptive card with a timesheet reminder message is posted to each employee listed in an Excel sheet.
   - The card includes an acknowledgment button for the employee to submit their status.

2. **Track Acknowledgment**:
   - When the button is clicked, the flow captures the user's response and logs the status (submitted/not submitted) in the Excel sheet.

3. **Condition Logic**:
   - The flow checks if the acknowledgment button was clicked.
   - It records both the **submitted** and **not submitted** status for each employee.

4. **Excel Update**:
   - The flow updates the record in Excel with the latest status.

5. **Filter Array**:
   - A filter array action is used to identify employees who have not responded.

6. **Send Emails**:
   - If there are employees who have not submitted, an email is sent with a list of pending individuals.
   - If all employees have submitted their timesheets, a success email is sent to confirm that all submissions are complete.
